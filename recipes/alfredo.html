        <p>Meanwhile, in a large skillet melt butter and add chopped garlic. Cook on low for about 5 minutes, stirring often to prevent garlic from burning.
            Pour about a 1/4 cup of heavy cream into a small bowl. Add egg yolk and beat together; set aside.
            Pour remaining cream into the skillet. Increase heat to medium-high. As cream starts to boil, mix rapidly using a whisk. Add egg mixture slowly to prevent curdling, whisking until well blended. Stir in 1 cup Parmesan cheese until combined.
            Add remaining Parmesan cheese and parsley; mix until smooth. Remove from heat and serve over cooked pasta.
